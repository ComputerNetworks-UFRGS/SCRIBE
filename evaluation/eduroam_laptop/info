Dump of a laptop using the eduroam wifi.

Description by owner:
The chains nat_tor and filter_tor provide transparent proxying over tor.

The chains nat_clearnet and filter_clearnet are automatically generated by the ttpch tool (https://github.com/schachmat/ttpch).
The addresses reachable by local routing (here: eduroam subnet) are automatically added to the clearnet chains and are not running over tor.
Use case: for example network printers.

TCP port 32335 is used for multi-purpose ad-hox stuff (e.g. nc6 file sharing)

** Edited to remove uid match and limit match
