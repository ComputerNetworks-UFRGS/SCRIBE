A script to set up a host-based firewall on a PC. Written by Cornelius Diekmann around 2006.

A review in 2015:
Don't judge, I was jung ;-)
For example, LO_IP="127.0.0.1" is just plain nonsense. How could the nameserver-thing ever work?
LAN_IP_RANGE and LAN_BROADCAST are not consistent. But it worked at that time ;-)
Most of the knowledge was probably obtained from the frozentux tutorial.

I executed the script (fixing the path to iptables) in 2015 on my laptop to generate the iptables-save and iptables-Lnv dump.
